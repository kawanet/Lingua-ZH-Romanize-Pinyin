CXTERM 5.0 -- A Chinese Terminal Emulator for X Window System
-------------------------------------------------------------

----------
0. WHAT IS IT?

  A terminal emulator for X11, just like "xterm", but with the
  capability of displaying and inputting Chinese.

  Compared with the previous versions, cxterm 5.0 has a much more
  powerful input engine.  The basic idea is to use an "input-method-
  independent conversion module" and a "post-processing" technique
  to reduce the candidate set.  (See document Doc/input.doc, "Hanzi
  input in cxterm version 5.0".)  Other minor improvements include 
  scripts for easy installation (also does X fonts installation),
  a popup window for easier run-time configuration, more input
  methods, etc.

  It supports GB, Big5, JIS, and KS encoding.  HZ support is through
  "hztty", a separated program avaliable from
	ftp://ftp.cs.purdue.edu/pub/ygz/hztty.tar.gz

----------
1. REQUIREMENTS

  In short, you need a Unix account to hold the cxterm software and
  a display that allows you to open X windows from your Unix account.

  A) Hardware:  any hardware that supports Unix and X window

    Examples: 
      Workstations:  Sun, HP, DEC station, IBM RT or RS, SGI.
      High-end PCs:  386/486/Pentium PC with VGA (or better) or Mac.
      X terminal:    Visual X Terminal, NCD, HP/X.

      X terminal users must have access to the Unix back-end server
      machines.

    Disk space:
      About 6M disk space is needed for the source, and additional 10M
      is needed to build all the binaries.  The final binaries take
      about 3M-5M (depends on the configuration and machine type).

  B) Software:  Unix operating system and X Window System.

    X window version must be at least X11R4.  Other compatible window
    systems include: OpenWindow 3.x, DECwindow, XFree86, etc.

    Your system must come with all the necessary files to support X
    application development, which include all the header files and
    link libraries for X11, Xt, Xaw, Xmu, and Xext.  Although these
    are included in the standard release from X Consortium, some
    companies do not include them in their systems (e.g. AIXwindow).
    If you have such an incomplete X window, you have three choices:
    1) request the whole X development environment from your vendor,
    2) get the complete X window from ftp.x.org and build it yourself,
    3) find someone generous to give you a pre-compiled cxterm in the
    platform.

    386/486/Pentium PC users must run Lunix or other Unix operating
    systems (e.g., SCO, UNIX386, BSD386/386bsd) and XFree86.  Cxterm
    will not run in DOS or Windows or Window NT.

    Macintosh users must run A/UX (no Macintosh OS), DECstation users
    must run OSF/1 or Ultrix (no VMS), IBM RT/RS must run AIX (no OS/2).

    X terminal font installation may require root privilege.  Check
    with system manager.

  C) Fair amount of expertise on UNIX and X11.

    Unix or X11 newbie may feel difficulty in installing cxterm.  If
    someone can set it up for you, it is easy to use.

2. HOW TO INSTALL THE SOFTWARE

  A) Get cxterm source code from the Internet.

     If you view this document under WWW, just click here:
     <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.purdue.edu/pub/ygz/cxterm-5.0.tar.gz">
     <code>ftp://ftp.cs.purdue.edu/pub/ygz/cxterm-5.0.tar.gz</code></A>

     Or use ftp to get cxterm from a ftp site near you.  The master
     ftp site for cxterm is ftp.cs.purdue.edu: /pub/ygz/.  An example
     ftp session is:

	csh%  ftp ftp.cs.purdue.edu
	username:  anonymous
	password:  <your-e-mail-address>

	ftp>  binary
	ftp>  cd /pub/ygz
	ftp>  get cxterm-5.0.tar.gz
	ftp>  bye

  B) Unpack the source code archive:

	csh%  gzip -dc cxterm-5.0.tar.gz | tar xvf -
	csh%  cd cxterm-5.0

     If you don't have gzip, get it from a GNU ftp site (e.g.
     prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/gzip*).   (If you find some ftp site
     that has cxterm-5.0.tar.Z, use "zcat" instead of "gzip -dc".)

  C) Just type

	csh%  ./config.sh

     and follow the instructions.  Good luck! 

  D) After installation ...

     Try to run cxterm (see 3).  If everything goes where and when you
     decide that you don't need the cxterm source code any more, you
     may remove the cxterm source code tree by:

	csh%  cd ..
	csh%  rm cxterm-5.0.tar.gz
	csh%  rm -rf cxterm-5.0

----------
3. HOW TO RUN CXTERM

  The cxterm installation script should have tried to set up everything
  for you.  What you need is probably to make sure that directory you
  choose for cxterm binaries are in the PATH.

  If you are a new user, or not quite understand X resources or X font
  paths, etc., simply use the command "CXterm".

  To run cxterm with GB encoding, type:		CXterm -gb &
  with Big5, type:				CXterm -big5 &
  with Japanese (JIS), type:			CXterm -jis &
  with Korean (KS), type:			CXterm -ks &

  Experienced user can use "cxterm" directly, but first make sure that
  the X resource was kept in the right place by ./config.sh, and
  remember to put the font path to your X window startup file
  (usually ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession).  See cxterm(1) (or the file
  cxterm/cxterm.man) for cxterm options.

  Read "Doc/input.doc" on how to input Chinese in cxterm.

5. SUPPORTS

  Cxterm 5.0 is tested or known to work in the following platform:
  - Sun SPARCstation (or Sun 3) with SunOS 4.x or Solaris 2.x
    (X11R4 / X11R5 / X11R6 / OpenWindow 3.0)

  In case you have a problem with cxterm, read Doc/CXTERM.FAQ first
  to see if there is already a solution for you.  I will continue
  update the CXTERM.FAQ.  The latest version of the FAQ can be ftp'ed
  or viewed from WWW at "ftp://ftp.cs.purdue.edu/pub/ygz/CXTERM.FAQ".

  Since the most-likely problem is that your system configuration is
  a little bit different, people within your department, such as the
  system manager or local Unix/X guru are the best source of help.
  Outsiders like us usually do not have any insight about your system
  and are often helpless.

  If you must seek help from outside, be sure to obtain as much detail
  as possible.  Include such information as the machine name and model,
  the operating system name and version, the window system name and
  version, the output of "xdpyinfo" and "xset q", and the script that
  shows how you do it and how it fails.  Send them to the author(s)
  at <c-xterm@cs.purdue.edu>, or post them to such newsgroups as
  alt.chinese.computing.

  Send your comments, bugs, and suggestions to <c-xterm@cs.purdue.edu>

  Future development of cxterm will be announced in CCNET-L and 
  related newsgroups including alt.chinese.computing.
